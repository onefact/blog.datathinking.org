# The Rationale

The research question arises from personal observations of varying levels of creative abilities among classmates based on the burden of homework and academic expectations. This observation suggests a potential connection between excessive schoolwork and limitations on students' artistic skills.

What is known:
It is widely acknowledged that high school students often face substantial workloads and academic pressure. However, the impact of this workload on students' creative abilities remains relatively unexplored. Existing research primarily focuses on the academic performance, mental health, and overall well-being of students under similar circumstances. Limited attention has been given to the specific effects of excessive schoolwork on creativity.

What is unknown:
The relationship between excessive schoolwork and students' creative abilities remains unclear. It is unknown whether the heavy workload itself directly restricts creative thinking or if other factors contribute to the observed variations in creative skills. Additionally, the extent to which different academic disciplines influence creative abilities remains unexplored.

Decisions and decision-makers:
If the research supports the hypothesis that excessive schoolwork restricts students' creative abilities, it would necessitate decision-making at multiple levels. Educators and curriculum planners would need to reassess the balance between academic demands and opportunities for creative expression. School administrators may consider implementing strategies to promote a more holistic approach to education that nurtures both academic and creative development. Policymakers could use the findings to inform educational policies that prioritize a balanced workload and foster creativity in students. Ultimately, the decisions regarding curriculum design, teaching methods, and resource allocation would be made collaboratively by educational stakeholders at various levels.

# The Stakes

The consequences of the research findings can impact various individuals and systems within the educational landscape.

Students: Students themselves have a significant stake in this research question. If it is determined that excessive schoolwork does indeed limit their creative abilities, students may face the consequences of suppressed artistic expression and restricted opportunities for creative growth. On the other hand, if the research suggests that excessive schoolwork does not have a substantial impact on creativity, students may be relieved from concerns about the potential trade-off between academic success and creative development.

Educators: Teachers and educators have a direct role in shaping students' academic experiences. The research findings can influence their instructional practices and decisions regarding homework assignments. If excessive schoolwork is found to hinder creativity, educators may need to reconsider the amount and nature of homework tasks, allowing for more time and opportunities for creative exploration and expression. Alternatively, if the research shows limited effects of excessive schoolwork on creativity, educators may continue with their current practices but with a better understanding of the potential trade-offs.

School Systems: School systems and administrators bear responsibility for curriculum design, policies, and resource allocation. The research findings may prompt them to evaluate and potentially revise existing educational structures to strike a better balance between academic demands and creative development. This could involve reevaluating grading systems, considering flexible scheduling, or incorporating dedicated time and resources for artistic and creative pursuits within the curriculum.

Parents and Families: Parents and families are invested in their children's education and well-being. The research findings can influence their perceptions and decisions regarding their children's academic priorities. If excessive schoolwork is found to restrict creativity, parents may advocate for changes in school policies or seek alternative educational environments that better foster their child's artistic abilities.

Society and Workforce: The broader society has a stake in the research question as well. Creativity is valued in various professions and industries, such as the arts, design, innovation, and entrepreneurship. If excessive schoolwork is indeed limiting students' creative abilities, it may have long-term consequences for the availability of creative talent in these fields, potentially impacting societal and economic innovation.

Overall, the stakes of the research question involve students, educators, school systems, parents, and society at large. The decisions made based on the research findings can have material consequences on educational practices, individual well-being, and the overall cultivation of creativity within the education system and beyond.
