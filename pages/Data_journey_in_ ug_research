DATA JOURNEY 

Data Thinking course:
What was the first class like?
I had no idea what this course was about. I had a few words in mind that was giving a description of the course, but what they really mean, words like DATA, THINKING, DATA THINKING
The first class was an epic entry introduction to DATA. More like Jaan cool down our nerve and ask us to be curious about DATA itself So that it will start speaking on its own
, Sounds pretty cool. And yes, it is! That's how it started.

WHAT DID I LEARN?
I am taking so much from here. The clearest skill is Trying out new things, whether it is a new tool (Git, GitHub, Latex, Copilot) or new software, I am more comfortable 
diving in and playing with it. I got exposure to new words, concepts, and insights that will help me in the future For sure. [FEEL, ASK, DO]!!!


IN INDIA MANY RESEARCHERS EMERGE IN UG ITSELF, I AM TRYING TO GET THE PATTERNS AND FIELDS THEY CHOOSE FOR THEIR PH.D.
What is known:
India has a burgeoning higher education sector, with an increasing number of students enrolling in undergraduate programs.
Traditionally, fields like engineering, medical sciences, and technology have been popular among Indian students.
There is a general interest in research and innovation in India, as evidenced by the increase in the number of research papers and patents being filed by Indian scholars.

What is unknown:
Detailed insights into the emerging trends and patterns in the fields of study chosen by undergraduate students for Ph.D. research in India.
The factors influencing the selection of specific fields for Ph.D. research among Indian undergraduates.
The extent to which socio-economic background, geographic location, and educational exposure influence the choices of fields of study.

Decisions to be made and by whom:
Academic Institutions: They need to decide on how to allocate resources to different fields based on the trends to ensure that they are offering programs that are in demand. They may also need to create programs that encourage diversity in research fields.
Government and Policy Makers: They need to decide on the funding and support for different fields of research. Understanding the trends can help them in formulating policies that ensure balanced growth across various fields.
Students and Aspiring Researchers: They can make informed decisions regarding their fields of interest and the prospects in these fields.

Industry: Knowing the trends in academic research can help industries decide on collaborations and investments in research and development.

This research question can provide valuable insights into the decision-making processes of the various stakeholders involved in the academic and research ecosystem in India. It can also help in understanding if there are any gaps or biases in the fields being chosen, and whether or not there is a need for diversification in research fields.
