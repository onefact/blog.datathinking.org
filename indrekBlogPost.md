# Gender-Based Analysis of Tartu Bike Sharing Service

Authors: Indrek Romet & ChatGPT

A bike-sharing service was launched in Tarth in 2019. The usage patterns of this system in Tartu, especially in comparison with other cities, are not fully known. Data from Australia, UK and Canada show women use bikes at rates of only 21%,  29% and 30%, respectively, while in Germany, Denmark and the Netherlands, 40% or more of the rides are by females (Pucher & Buehler, 2008). This blog post analyzes differences in bike usage between males and females in Tartu based on 2022 bike-sharing usage data. 

What are the differences in bike usage patterns between male and female smart bike users in Tartu?" With the increasing emphasis on sustainable modes of transport, understanding user demographics and behaviours is crucial in shaping policies and systems that cater to the needs of diverse user groups. My interest in this topic arises from the observation that gender dynamics in urban mobility are often overlooked, potentially leading to skewed services that may not fully cater to all demographics.

The findings of this research could provide valuable insights to city planners and transportation providers. If significant differences are found, it could indicate a need to revise the smart bike services to make them more inclusive and accessible to all users. This could result in improved user experience, increased usage of smart bikes, and progress toward the environmental goals of reducing carbon emissions and promoting healthier lifestyles.

## The Data 

Every ride taken in the bike-sharing system is recorded (https://geohub.tartulv.ee & https://ratas.tartu.ee/). Among the recorded information points, some relevant ones are:

- The first digits of a user's Personal Id Code represent gender. An even number is for females, and an odd number is for males. (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/compliance/sit-defn-estonia-personal-identification-code?view=o365-worldwide)
- The location, date and time of taking out the bike, and where and when it was dropped off
- The type of bicycle used (electric or regular)
- And other less useful information!

This data can allow us to learn more about trends and patterns in the gender of Tartu SmartBike users

After downloading the CSV files with all the monthly bike rides, I combined the files into one, as can be seen in the example code snippet below:

## Raw Research: How many users of each gender

An approximately 60-40 split between males and females. This is close to other bike-friendly countries in Europe, an encouraging sign.

And here is a population pyramid of the users over the warmer half of the year (as well as the part of the year with full bicycle availability)

## But what about during the winter?

The split is closer to 70-30, male to female respectively, in the winter.

And the population pyramid. Note: older age group too! (compared to summer months)

## Why is that? Are the bikes to blame?

There are no electric bikes offered during the winter months. Could the percentages between genders be greatly changed because of a lack of electric bikes offered? Looking at the preference in the summer months, when both types of bikes are fully available, we see that there is a difference between bicycle preferences. This would lead to inconclusive evidence on what drive this difference in demographics.

## While we're here, can we predict the length of a trip based on age and gender?

Absolutely not, totally pointless, but worth the try.

Here is the formula for linear regression:

And in our case specifically:

## Conclusion and sources

The data from the Tartu SmartBike usage shows that the share of bike use between genders is similar to other European bike-friendly nations. However, this share changes in the winter months.
